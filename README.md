# chess-clock
üï∞Ô∏è Pet project "Chess Clock".


This project is a clone of the chess clock from 'Chess.com'. The application is written programmatically using SnapKit. Instead of player buttons it was decided to use transparent views with UITapGestureRecognizer. The hitTest method of the central buttons was overrided for a better readout of the touches for user convenience.
In future versions, it is planned to save the selected game mode in User Defaults, as well as to pause the timers when the application enters the background
